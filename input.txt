Vanakkam everyone. In this project, we are building a fully offline text-to-speech system using Piper TTS, and namma goal is very clear: not even a single word should be missed. Indha system input ah carefully process pannum, especially when the paragraph contains Tamil and English mixed together. For example, “Namma AI model 2026 la launch panna plan panrom,” and it should correctly pronounce both the year 2026 and the Tamil sentence structure without confusion. Sometimes users type Roman Tamil like “enna da idhu, super ah irukku,” and the model must handle that smoothly.
In addition, technical words like neural network, ONNX runtime, phoneme alignment, and spectrogram synthesis should be spoken clearly even when surrounded by Tamil phrases such as “idhu romba important concept.” The system must also handle decimal numbers like 3.14, percentages like 99.9 percent, and abbreviations like AI, NLP, TTS, CPU, and GPU without skipping or mispronouncing them. If the sentence says, “Indha model state-of-the-art speech synthesis use pannudhu,” the hyphenated English phrase should remain intact while Tamil words are spoken naturally.
Furthermore, long continuous text like “naan inniku presentation ku prepare panren, but at the same time testing the chunk segmentation logic to avoid overflow errors and buffer issues” must not cause sudden silence or repeated audio segments. Even expressions such as “seri, let’s check whether the pipeline works properly or illa problem varudha?” should be rendered with smooth intonation and proper pacing. Finally, if Piper reads this entire mixed-language paragraph from start to finish without dropping any token, syllable, or number, then your TTS implementation is truly stable, robust, and ready for real-world deployment in multilingual environments like India.
